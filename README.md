## Installation

### Option 1: Standard Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd organisize
```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Apply database migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Create a superuser (admin):
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. Run the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Option 2: Docker Development Setup (Recommended)

For the best development experience with email testing, use Docker with MailHog:

#### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd organisize
```

2. Start the development environment:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start:
- **Django app** at http://localhost:8000
- **MailHog** (email testing) at http://localhost:8025

#### Email Testing with MailHog

MailHog captures all outgoing emails in development so you can:
- View sent emails at http://localhost:8025
- Test email functionality without sending real emails
- See email content and formatting

#### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up

# Run in background
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs web
docker-compose logs mailhog

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild after code changes
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Testing Email Delivery

After starting the Docker services, test email delivery:

```bash
# Method 1: Use the custom management command
python manage.py test_mailhog_email

# Method 2: Use Django's built-in sendtestemail command
python manage.py sendtestemail test@example.com

# Method 3: Run the standalone test script
python test_mailhog.py

# Method 4: Test with specific email address
python manage.py test_mailhog_email --email your@email.com

# Method 5: Test only HTML emails
python manage.py test_mailhog_email --html-only
```

Then visit http://localhost:8025 to see the test emails in MailHog.

#### Environment Configuration

The Docker setup uses `.env.dev` for development settings:
- `DEBUG=True`
- Email routing to MailHog
- Development-friendly configurations

For production, create a `.env` file with your production settings.

## Technology Stack

- Django 4.2.20
- Bootstrap 5.3.0
- SQLite (default database)
- Python 3.x
- Docker & Docker Compose (development)
- MailHog (email testing)

```

## Development

- The project uses Django's built-in authentication system
- Bootstrap is included via CDN for styling
- Model structure includes:
  - VacationPlan
  - Flight
  - Lodging
  - Activity
  - Group (for collaboration)

### Running Tests

The project includes comprehensive automated testing to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Quick Test Run
```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run tests with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
coverage html  # Generate HTML coverage report
```

#### Using the Test Runner Script
```bash
# Run the automated test script
./run_tests.sh
```

#### Test Structure
- **Model Tests**: Validate database models and their relationships
- **Form Tests**: Ensure form validation works correctly
- **View Tests**: Test view functionality and authentication
- **URL Tests**: Verify URL routing and resolution

#### Coverage Requirements
The test suite aims for high coverage of:
- All model methods and validations
- Form validation logic
- View authentication and responses
- URL routing

View coverage reports in `htmlcov/index.html` after running coverage.

## Deployment

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment to AWS Lightsail with integrated testing:

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Deploy to Lightsail
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    # Run comprehensive test suite with coverage
    
  deploy:
    needs: test  # Deployment only runs if tests pass
    # Deploy to AWS Lightsail
```

### Test Automation Features

- **Automated Testing**: All tests run on every push to main branch
- **Coverage Reporting**: Track test coverage across the codebase
- **Deployment Blocking**: Failed tests prevent deployment to production
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Tests models, views, forms, and URL routing

### Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually (not recommended for production):

1. SSH into your Lightsail instance
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the test suite: `./run_tests.sh`
4. If tests pass, proceed with deployment steps

### Test-Driven Deployment Process

1. Developer pushes code to main branch
2. GitHub Actions triggers automated test suite
3. If tests fail, deployment is blocked and team is notified
4. If tests pass, deployment proceeds automatically
5. Production environment updated with tested code

## Authentication

- Login URL: `/accounts/login/`
- Logout URL: `/accounts/logout/`
- Default redirect after login: `vacation_list`
